# üß† DGP as a Universal Computational Framework

This repository contains all the scripts developed as part of a research project related to the **Distance Geometry Problem (DGP)**. The main objective of this project was to explore how the DGP could be used as a universal computational framework.

## üìå Project Overview

The goal of the project was to investigate whether the **Binary Linear Programming (BLP)** problem could be reduced to the **DGP** problem, and to leverage the geometric nature of DGP to apply geometric relaxations or continuous optimization techniques for solving it.

## üîß Implementations

This repository includes the following:

- A **reduction from BLP to SAT**, based on a method developed by J.P. Warners (J.P. Warners. A linear-time transformation of linear inequalities into conjunctive normal form. Information Processing Letters).
- A **reduction from BLP to DGP**, developed during this project.
- Several **variants** of the BLP ‚Üí DGP reduction, each implemented and available for exploration.
- A **dynamic programming algorithm** that solves the Subset Sum problem, created as part of an attempt to model BLP using DGP techniques.

## üìà Notes

The reductions and algorithms presented here were developed as part of a theoretical and experimental research effort. The hope is that by using DGP‚Äôs geometric properties, certain combinatorial problems might be more tractably solved or approximated via continuous methods.
